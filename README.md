Changes:
So I did a whole revamp of the game. It is less scary and more action now. So the story behind the game is a cat that wakes up in a dungeon and you have a glock and you have to find your cat family. You have a helicopter hat that allows you to fly around the dungeon and you have to defeat monsters and look and find the right room that leads you to your kids. So the game is still a platformer,  but there isn’t a wall stopping you or forcing you to move forward. It is a platformer but you have to explore to find the correct room to find the cat family. The cool thing is when you die, you go to Cat Heaven and there, you will find your family. When you go to Cat Heaven, there is a door that leads you back to where you started so essentially the game is a loop, where even if you die, you get to go back and find the correct route to your kids (who are in Cat Heaven).  When you go to Cat Heaven, the music will change and you get a halo. A cool feature is in cat heaven you don't have a health bar because you’re in heaven. A lot of the tiles used to create the platformer were actually my own creation. Some tiles were found. The Weapons and the Cat pixel art were found online. The Enemy Pixel art was done by me. What I think is the most cool about my game is even if you die, you can go back, and it's part of the game
Features the Game has:
Music, Toggleable with pressing M
Movement with the WASD and arrow keys,
Shoot weapons, automatic or semi automatic by clicking or holding down the key pad
Toggle Weapons with pressing 1 when you near a weapon

Player heathbar and enemy health Bar, 
Weapons that will deal damage and kill enemies
Sound Effects for getting hurt, killing enemies, different background music for different character 
Different enemy art
THe ability to travel between doors to lead to different places in a scene or would load up a different map (a new scene basically) by pressing E.



Original Proposal:
The game will be called “Escape Now!” Im thinking about doing a platformer game kinda like mario where the character moves from left to right where the character is controlled by the mouse. And the character is not able to touch the walls, and the actual platform is going to be the one moving. The win condition would be the character makes it through the maze without touching the walls. If the character touches the wall, then it's game over. So imagine like those kid surgery games where they cannot touch the holes or else you have to restart over. Think about that one Bloody Mary Game where you can touch the walls, or you get jump scared. I want something like that. 

The controls would be the mouse and your character is where your mouse points. The platform will move by itself so you do not have to worry about it. I might change it in the future and have WASD movement where the player uses the keyboard inputs to control the characters.

For the game concept, I am thinking maybe a scary game where the character has to keep moving forward in order to escape the ghost or monster or a killer. I think because the character cannot touch the walls, I can probably come up with a good reason such as the walls are poisonous or if you touch the wall, a monster will grab the character. 

The art asset will have to include the background, the platform material, the character sprite, and art for the enemies. I think I want to come up with my pixel art as I would have full control over the design of the environment and what I want it to look like and the feeling it will invoke.

For the game flow, it is pretty simple. As long as the player continues throughout the platform and does get stuck or touch the walls or let the main enemy touch the character then it will not be game over. The player will have to get to the door that will be like the tower at the end of a mario level. The player has to escape the maze that the creature is following it through, or else they will lose. 

I would like to create or use eerie sounds, maybe like space noise. I think I want to use space noise because it gives off an eerie feeling that typical spooky tracks do not. I feel like those spooky tracks are cliche and come off as funny rather than eerie. 



One of the big challenges is programming the platform to move and how the player will interact with the walls. I am not sure completely yet if I want to have the character follow the mouse or have the player use the WASD keys to control. I think if I did the WASD keys, it would have to be more difficult because I would be programming the character speed and making sure the character will die if they touch the walls.
